# Dijkstra's Algorithm

This is a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest distance between two points. Google/Apple maps uses this kind of algorithm to produce directions.

The paths are weighted - meaning that some routes are harder to travel on than others. In real-life, this could be due to things such as traffic, slow speed limits, or long distances.

It is [deployed here](https://dijkstras-algorithm.netlify.app/).
